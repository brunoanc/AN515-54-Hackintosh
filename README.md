## Installation

### First-time installation

- Set-up the BIOS configuration:
  - Boot to BIOS by pressing F2 during boot.
  - In the Main screen, enable F12 boot menu, disable Fast Boot, then press Ctrl+S and change the new SATA mode option to AHCI.
  - In the Boot screen, disable secure boot.
  - Finally, go to the Exit screen and select "Exit saving changes".
- Read through the following tutorial to create a bootable USB, and then place the EFI folder inside it:
   - https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/
- You should add Serial Number, UUID, MLB and ROM details to Config -> PlatformInfo -> Generic if you want to get iServices working as explained [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html).

### Post Install

- Clone the [ComboJack repo](https://github.com/hackintosh-stuff/ComboJack) and run the installer inside the `ComboJack_Installer` folder to get the jack port working correctly.
- Run the following commands for sleep wake:
  ```
  sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
  sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
  sudo pmset -a standby 0
  sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
  ```
- If dual-booting with Windows, follow [this](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/fix-incorrect-time-in-windows-osx-dual-boot.133719/) guide to fix time.

## Disable CFG Lock (Advanced users only)

To disable CFG Lock, follow [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/hz2rtm/cfg_lockunlocking_alternative_method/) guide. Note that you'll be modifying the BIOS, so be very careful or you could end up bricking your device. If you're not sure about something, do NOT do it.

After following the guide, disable Kernel -> Quirks -> AppleXcpmCfgLock and you're done.
